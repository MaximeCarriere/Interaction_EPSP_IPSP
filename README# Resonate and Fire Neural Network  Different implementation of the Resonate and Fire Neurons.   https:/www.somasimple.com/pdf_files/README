# Interaction EPSP-IPSP in two neurons

Two neurons, one excitatory the other inhibitory 
The integration is performed by Runge-Kutta

The code needs to be fed with two inputs corresponding of the conductance 
The conductance can be here considered as the synaptic strength

Graphic representations:
    - Membrane Potential of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons over time.
